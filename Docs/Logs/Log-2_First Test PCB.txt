The first PCBs arrived last week, as did the case I ordered from a local Music store!

Look how perfectly they fit!

Next steps will be designing more modules which support more types of Thing (as cool as Cherry-MX keyswitches are, they can't do everything).

Fingers crossed the next few parts fit too!
