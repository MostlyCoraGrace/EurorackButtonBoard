# Special Thanks
- A special thanks has to go [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com/g/odjF56), for providing me with free PCBs (and discounts on PCBs when I ask for too many of them, because this project is *voluminous*).
- I would also like to thank my girlfriend, who gave me enough money to buy the first set of electronics I needed to make version 1 of this project. It was expensive.
